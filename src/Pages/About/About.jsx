                    <h1>I am Noorullah Noori!</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am web and graphic designer based in Kabul,
                        Afghanistan, with deep passion for creating both
                        stunning and functional digital experiences. My journey
                        in web design began with a fascination for the
                        intersection of art and technology, leading me to
                        specialize in crafting visually appealing and
                        user-friendly websites. I believe that every pixel
                        matters, and I strive to create designs that not only
                        look great but also enhance user experiences. I
                        specialize in designing and developing websites that not
                        only look great but also provide seamless, intuitive
                        user experiences. I believe in the power of design to
                        solve problems, communicate ideas, and make a lasting
                        impact. Whether it is crafting an eye catching interface
                        or building a responsive website, I am always focused on
                        delivering work that brings ideas to life and adds value
                        to the user.
